R0KETMAP

Logs the locations of all the r0ket badges and displays them on a map (with a vague shape that roughly gives you the extents of the bcc building). You can click one of the dots to select it, which will display that badge's ID (and the nickname if present).

You can use the slider to rewind from "live" view to any previously retrieved state.

No magic in here, this gets its information from the same JSON on the web that the official trackers provide.
